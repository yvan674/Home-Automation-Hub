# Home-Automation-Hub

## Introduction
The idea is to create a Python application that runs on a touchscreen raspberry pi that is able to handle all smart appliances within my apartment.
The application should handle mostly lighting and heating and perhaps other things added later on.
It has a two part system: A home assistant server runs on the pi while a python GUI runs on top of it to allow access from the pi itself with a touchscreen.
